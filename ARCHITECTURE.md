# FlameLang Architecture

## Overview

FlameLang v2.0.0 is a sovereign compiler toolchain implementing a novel 5-layer transformation pipeline that bridges linguistic, biological, and quantum computing paradigms.

## 5-Layer Transformation Pipeline

### Layer 1: Linguistic Transformation
**English → Hebrew**
- Translates source code from English keywords to Hebrew symbolic representation
- Preserves semantic meaning while enabling alternative linguistic encoding
- Foundation for multi-lingual compilation strategies

### Layer 2: Numeric Transformation  
**Unicode → Decimal**
- Converts Unicode characters to decimal numeric representations
- Provides numerical encoding of linguistic structures
- Enables mathematical operations on code structure

### Layer 3: Wave Transformation
**c=2πr → Hz**
- Maps numeric values to wave frequencies using fundamental physics
- Applies the relationship between circumference and radius (c=2πr)
- Converts code structure into sonic/frequency domain
- Just intonation principles for harmonic code properties

### Layer 4: DNA Transformation
**Freq → Codon**
- Encodes wave frequencies as DNA codons (ATGC sequences)
- Creates biological representation of code
- Enables bio-computing and DNA storage paradigms
- Foundation for FlameVault quantum-resistant encryption

### Layer 5: LLVM Code Generation
**Codon → LLVM IR**
- Generates LLVM Intermediate Representation from DNA encoding
- Produces executable machine code
- Maintains traceability through all transformation layers
- Enables traditional compilation and optimization

## Signature Patterns

### Node 137 Motif
Throughout the codebase, Node 137 appears as a quantum-ready architecture marker, representing the fine structure constant (≈1/137) fundamental to quantum mechanics.

### 7% Charity Trigger
A recurring pattern in resource allocation and distribution algorithms, ensuring sustainable and ethical computing practices.

## Tools

### flamec - FlameLang Compiler
The main compiler frontend that orchestrates the 5-layer pipeline transformation.

**Usage:**
```bash
flamec <source.flame>
```

### flamefmt - Code Formatter
Formats FlameLang source code with biological-inspired aesthetics.

**Usage:**
```bash
flamefmt <source.flame>
```

### flamelsp - Language Server Protocol
Provides IDE integration for FlameLang development.

**Features:**
- Syntax highlighting
- Code completion
- Inline diagnostics
- Pipeline visualization (planned)

## Integration Points

### FlameVault (INV-076)
Quantum-resistant encryption using layer permutation. Leverages the DNA encoding layer for cryptographic operations.

### FlameViz (INV-077)
Data visualization with provable chart generation and sonic fingerprinting. Utilizes wave transformation layer.

### AetherViz (INV-078)
Code self-visualization and sonification. Provides real-time view of code structure through all 5 layers.
