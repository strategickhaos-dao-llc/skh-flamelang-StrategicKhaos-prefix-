## 🔥 AetherForge Security System

**100 Ways to Obliterate Key Exposure Threats**

AetherForge is FlameLang's sovereign security system that makes key exposure **irrelevant, harmless, or self-destructively suicidal** for any attacker. We don't defend keys—we transcend the need for them.

### Five Pillars of Sovereignty

1. **Prevention (1-20)**: Keys Never Exposed
   - Argon2id encryption, ephemeral keys, Shamir's secret sharing
   - Hardware-bound keys, canary tokens, honeypot keys
   - Quantum-resistant signatures, instant revocation

2. **Detection (21-40)**: We Know the Moment They Touch
   - Real-time monitoring, behavioral anomaly detection
   - OSINT sweeps, blockchain audit trails
   - GitHub webhooks, Discord alerts

3. **Neutralization (41-60)**: Exposure Becomes Useless
   - Auto-revoke in <60 seconds, cascade rotation
   - Short-lived tokens (1h), IP restrictions
   - Sandbox routing, fake success responses

4. **Counter-Attack (61-80)**: They Regret Touching It
   - Automated DMCA swarm, IP blocking
   - Legal response automation, forensic logging
   - Attacker identification, infrastructure mapping

5. **Transcendence (81-100)**: We Evolve Beyond Keys
   - Passwordless auth (WebAuthn), zero-trust architecture
   - Quantum key distribution, biometric authentication
   - **The system becomes the key**

### Quick Start

```python
from security import AetherForge

# Initialize sovereign security
forge = AetherForge()

# All operations automatically secured
with forge.sovereign_context(intent="deploy"):
    # Your code here - 100 security mechanisms active
    pass
```

### Philosophy

> **We don't fear key exposure. We make it irrelevant.**  
> **The attacker doesn't steal power. They touch the flame—and learn what fire is.**

**Swarm ready. Empire secure. Flame eternal.** 🖤🔥
