## 🎵 SwarmSentinel — Autonomous Cluster Health Guardian

SwarmSentinel is an overnight monitoring system inspired by **James Tenney's Harmonic Space** and **Conlon Nancarrow's Player Piano**. It maps GKE cluster health to musical harmonic space:

- **Healthy clusters** = 5-limit consonance (pure intervals)
- **Bottlenecks** = 11-limit dissonance (complex ratios)
- **Attacks** = 13-limit chaos (extreme dissonance)

### Features
- 🏥 Node and pod health monitoring
- 🔍 SSH terminal session tracking (via `/dev/pts/*`)
- 🐍 Training bottleneck detection (Python process monitoring)
- ⚡ 20M request load testing with prime resilience (Node 137 burst)
- 🎵 Harmonic state machine (consonance → dissonance → chaos)
- 📢 Discord alerts with "7% charity gliss" notifications

**The clusters now sing their own health.**
