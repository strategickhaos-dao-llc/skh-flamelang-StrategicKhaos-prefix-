FlameLang Tutorial: DNA Encoding and Biological Computing
=========================================================

[00:00] Introduction
Welcome to FlameLang! I'm excited to teach you about DNA Encoding and Biological Computing.
                
FlameLang is a revolutionary programming language that combines quantum computing, 
biological systems, and wave physics into a unified computational framework.

In this tutorial, you'll learn: Understand dna encoding and biological computing, Write FlameLang code, Explore the 5-layer pipeline.

Let's dive in!

[00:30] Concept Overview
Before we look at code, let's understand what DNA Encoding and Biological Computing means in FlameLang.

We'll start with the basics and build from there.

Remember, FlameLang operates through five transformation layers: 
Linguistic, Numeric, Wave, DNA, and LLVM. Each layer adds a dimension of computation.

Now let's see how this works in practice.

[01:15] Example 1
Let me walk you through this code. This code demonstrates core FlameLang syntax and patterns. Each line is processed through the 5-layer transformation pipeline to produce efficient machine code.

[02:15] 5-Layer Transformation Pipeline
Now watch as your FlameLang code transforms through all five layers.

First, Layer 1: Linguistic transformation maps English concepts to Hebrew semantics.

Layer 2: Numeric conversion translates Unicode to decimal representations.

Layer 3: Wave analysis applies frequency domain transformations.

Layer 4: DNA encoding maps computational states to biological codons.

Finally, Layer 5: LLVM IR generation produces executable machine code.

This multi-dimensional transformation is what makes FlameLang unique!

[02:40] Try It Yourself
Now it's your turn! Pause the video and try implementing DNA Encoding and Biological Computing yourself.

Here's a challenge: modify the code we just saw to add your own twist.

When you're ready, unpause to see a solution and compare your approach.

Remember, there's often more than one way to solve a problem in FlameLang!

[03:10] Conclusion
