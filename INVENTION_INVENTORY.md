# FlameLang Invention Inventory

## Overview
This document tracks the invention portfolio and technological innovations that comprise the FlameLang v2.0.0 compiler toolchain and ecosystem.

## Core Inventions

### 1. Multi-Dimensional Transformation Pipeline
**Category**: Compiler Architecture  
**Status**: In Development  
**Description**: A 5-layer transformation pipeline that converts human-readable code through multiple dimensional representations:
- Layer 1: English → Hebrew (linguistic transformation)
- Layer 2: Hebrew → Unicode (normalization and encoding)
- Layer 3: Unicode → Wave (physics-validated dimensional representation)
- Layer 4: Wave → DNA (biological encoding)
- Layer 5: DNA → LLVM (machine code generation)

### 2. Biological Compilation System
**Category**: Code Generation  
**Status**: Conceptual  
**Description**: A novel approach to code compilation that uses biological encoding principles (DNA-like structures) as an intermediate representation before final machine code generation.

### 3. Physics-Validated Dimensional Analysis
**Category**: Type System  
**Status**: In Development  
**Description**: A type system that incorporates physics-validated dimensional analysis to ensure type correctness at the quantum and wave level.

### 4. Native Quantum Primitives
**Category**: Language Features  
**Status**: Planned  
**Description**: Built-in language primitives for quantum computing operations, integrated directly into the compiler toolchain.

### 5. Sovereign Compiler Toolchain
**Category**: Infrastructure  
**Status**: In Development  
**Description**: A self-contained, independent compiler toolchain that operates without external dependencies on proprietary systems.

## Related Systems
