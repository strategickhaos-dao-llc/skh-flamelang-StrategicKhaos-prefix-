# Quick Start Guide - Section 1.5: Bar Charts

Get started with the bar charts tutorial in 3 easy steps!

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd section_1_5_bar_charts
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install:
- pandas (data manipulation)
- numpy (numerical computing)
- matplotlib (plotting)
- seaborn (statistical visualization)
- jupyter (notebook interface)

## Step 2: Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Your browser will open automatically showing the notebook dashboard.

## Step 3: Open and Run Notebooks

1. Click on any notebook to open it:
   - `try_1_5_1_bar_charts.ipynb` - Start here for basics
   - `try_1_5_2_grouped_bar_charts.ipynb` - Learn grouped charts
   - `try_1_5_3_stacked_bar_charts.ipynb` - Master stacked charts

2. Run the notebook:
   - Click the ⏩ (double right arrow) button to "Restart & Run All"
   - Or press `Shift + Enter` to run each cell individually

## Alternative: Test Without Jupyter

If you just want to verify everything works:

```bash
python test_notebooks.py
```

This will run automated tests on all notebook functionality.

## What You'll Learn

After completing these notebooks, you'll be able to:

✅ Create professional bar charts in Python  
✅ Customize charts with titles, labels, and colors  
✅ Compare groups with grouped bar charts  
✅ Show composition with stacked bar charts  
✅ Use both vertical and horizontal orientations  
✅ Work with real-world datasets (Titanic, workforce data, etc.)  

## Need Help?

- See the [main README](README.md) for detailed documentation
- Check the [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for package versions
- Run [test_notebooks.py](test_notebooks.py) to verify your setup

## Examples You'll Create

### Basic Bar Charts
Compare values across categories (e.g., largest U.S. employers)

### Grouped Bar Charts
Compare multiple groups (e.g., Titanic survival by class and gender)

### Stacked Bar Charts
Show composition and totals (e.g., collision causes, healthcare spending)

## Tips

- Each notebook is self-contained with explanations and examples
- Exercise sections at the end let you practice with your own data
- All visualizations use publication-quality styling
- Code is well-commented and follows best practices

Happy learning! 📊
